# Simple Notes app front end

This repository contains the front end for a simple Notes application.
Before using this repo, set up the backend first. The back end is found [here](https://github.com/NikolayKolov/devteams-notes-server).

The front end is written in TypeScript and uses React 18, Material UI 5, React Router V6 for client side routing, [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) for data fetching and caching, [Zod](https://zod.dev/) for form data validation.

The user must be logged in to access the interface to create, edit and delete notes. Each user has access to only the notes he has created.
The notes can be of 2 types - text or checklist.

Both the frontend and the backend run on the same server (localhost) and must be run on the same machine.
The frontend uses a proxy setting in the vite.config.ts file to communicate with the backend on localhost.
These settings must be changed for a production deployment.

The folder structure for the project should be: a main folder named /Notes, and in it 2 folders: /server and /client.
Set up the back end and fron end in the /server and /client folders accordingly.

## Project set-up

1. Set up the back end first.
2. Set up a folder stucture for the project, if you haven't already:
  - Create a main folder, for example /Notes.
  - Set up the backend in a folder /Notes/server, for example.
  - Create a folder /Notes/client for the frontend.
3. Copy or clone the repo in the frontend folder.
3. Test if you have NodeJS installed.
  - In Command Prompt, type 'node -v' and execute. If an error appears, go to [this site](https://nodejs.org/) and install latest stable version from there.
4. Open the frontend folder with Visual Studio code, and open a terminal and execute command 'npm install'.
5. Open the NPM Scripts menu on the bottom left part and run the script 'dev', or type 'npm run vite'.
